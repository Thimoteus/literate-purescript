Test file for literate-purescript.

Due to purs ide reasons, it's easier not to self-host the transpiler.

Here's the module name:
```purescript
module Test.Main where
```

And here are the imports:
```purescript
import Prelude
import Control.Monad.Eff (Eff)
import Control.Monad.Eff.Console (CONSOLE, log)
```

And this is the entrypoint:
```purescript
main :: forall e. Eff (console :: CONSOLE | e) Unit
main = do
  log "Here is the source!"
```

Voila!
